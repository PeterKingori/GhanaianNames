			<p>The <span>Akan people</span> of <span>Ghana</span> have a distinct naming system of their children. Newborns are named depending on the day of the week they are born. These names have special meanings as a symbol of their culture, ancestral ties, and even concerning the soul and character of the child. This tradition naming system is also followed in other <span>West African</span> countries with distinct varieties.</p>
			<p>Most Ghanaians have a name from this system, as well as an English or Christian name. Prominent people named using this system include the former United Nations Secretrary-General, <span>Koffi Atta Annan</span>, who was named for being born on a <span>Friday</span>. Another notable person is <span>Kwame Nkrumah</span>, Ghana's first persident, named for being born on a <span>Saturday</span>.</p>
