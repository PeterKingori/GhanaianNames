## Description
This web application takes a user's input which include the date of birth and gender and outputs their Akan name determined by Ghana culture. It uses Javascript functions and an algorithm to calculate the day of the week the user was born on. The calculation uses the date of birth split into the day of the month, the month of birth and the year split into the century digits and year digits.
